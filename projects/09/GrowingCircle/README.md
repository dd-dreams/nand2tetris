# GrowingCircle

This is a little game I invented.

All you have to do is...actually nothing.

You move around a circle using the arrows key, and you can increase his size by pressing `W`.



You can change the limit of the Circle in Main.jack, second parameter.



# FYI

I couldn't fix the problem that the circle is looking like its lagging and disppearing. If it keep growing this problem will get more worse. Anyway...I tried atleast.



Hope you enjoy :)
